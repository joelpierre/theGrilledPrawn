## Foolproof Task
No need to run ```npm install``` as everything has been compiled. Please make sure you have an internet connection to load the webfonts form the google webfont server.

The following are complete:

* HTML, CSS and JS have been developed for the page
* No frameworks used. I recreated a grid for this specific build. But only what was needed.
* ES6+ syntax used for all script files.
* Page is fully responsive (Desktop, Small Desktop/Tablet Landscape, Tablet Portrait and Mobile).
* Add and Remove users to signup form.
* Roboto used as font link. (From google webfonts).
* Material Design Icons used as font link. (From google webfonts).

I also added some extras:
* Mobile navigation
* Open and Close filter options
* JS object created for recipes to resemble an API call
* Tested on all major browsers (latest 2 versions, Safari | Firefox | Chrome) - If I owned a windows comp, then I would have tested it in Microsoft Edge :-p.

________

All non compiled files can be found in the 'assets' folder. This includes the SCSS files for styling and ES6+ JS files, which are compiled into main.bundle.js

**** Should you have trouble loading the index file then you can run ```npm install``` and then ```npm run start```. This will run webpack and also open up a localhost port for you to view the page.
